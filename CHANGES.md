  - Supports Python 3.9+ as required
  - Enables hierarchical configuration with environment variables and config files

### Verified
- Package successfully installed via pip install -r requirements.txt
- Confirmed compatibility with existing configuration system
### 2025-04-28
- Updated configuration settings in slot_analyzer/config/__init__.py:
  - Added ENV, DEBUG, CAPTURE_THROTTLE_MS, MAX_CAPTURE_QUEUE fields
  - Updated environment variable mappings to match .env file
  - Added field descriptions and default values
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing configuration
- Created test_config.py to verify production mode loading
## [2025-04-28] Path Configuration Fixes

### Fixed
- Resolved "unsupported operand type(s) for /" error in config by:
  - Using Path.joinpath() instead of division operator for path joining
  - Making all paths relative to BASE_DIR
  - Adding .resolve() to BASE_DIR for absolute path consistency

### Added
- Path validation method validate_paths() that:
  - Creates required directories if they don't exist
  - Handles parent directory creation automatically
  - Runs automatically on settings initialization

### Updated
- Modified path definitions for:
  - DATA_DIR (now BASE_DIR/data)
  - SCREENSHOT_DIR (now BASE_DIR/screenshots) 
  - CERT_DIR (now BASE_DIR/certificates)
### Fixed
- Resolved FieldError by moving path joining operations to validate_paths()
- Updated validate_paths() to:
  - Join paths with BASE_DIR
  - Set full paths as attributes
  - Handle all directory creation in one place
### Fixed
- Updated environment variable names to match Pydantic expectations:
  - Simplified variable names (removed SLOT_ANALYZER_ prefix)
  - Made names consistent with field names
  - Fixed case sensitivity issues
### Fixed
- Aligned environment variable names with .env file:
  - Restored SLOT_ANALYZER_ prefix for all config variables
  - Ensured exact name matching between .env and config
  - Maintained backward compatibility
### Fixed
- Added Config.extra="ignore" to handle duplicate environment variables
- Ensured Pydantic won't reject valid configuration due to extra vars
### Fixed
- Updated validate_paths() to:
  - Return path dictionary instead of setting attributes
  - Work with existing fields only
  - Handle all path operations safely
## [2025-04-28] Pydantic Settings Update

### Updated
- Changed BaseSettings import in config.py from pydantic to pydantic_settings
