# Casino Slot Game Analysis Application Plan

## Core Components

### 1. Network Traffic Capture Module
- Intercepts HTTP/HTTPS/WS/WSS requests and responses
- Takes screenshots at each response
- Associates network data with visual game state
- Timestamps all captures for correlation

```python
# Key implementation in network_capture.py
class SlotGameCapture:
    def __init__(self, session_info):
        self.casino_name = session_info['casino_name']
        self.game_name = session_info['game_name']
        # Store captures with screenshots and timestamps
```

### 2. Symbol Recognition Module
- Extracts slot symbols from screenshots
- Uses template matching and/or ML-based recognition
- Maps symbols to specific positions on the game grid
- Associates symbols with corresponding network responses

```python
# Key implementation in symbol_recognition.py
class SymbolRecognizer:
    def extract_symbols(self, screenshot_path, game_layout):
        """Extract symbols from a screenshot based on game layout"""
        # Process image and identify symbols at specific positions
```

### 3. Pattern Recognition Module
- Analyzes captured data for patterns
- Correlates bet sizes with outcomes
- Identifies repeated response patterns
- Detects symbol combination frequencies
- Generates statistical reports on findings

```python
# Key implementation in pattern_recognition.py
class PatternAnalyzer:
    def analyze_session(self, captures):
        """Analyze a session for patterns in responses and symbols"""
        # Convert captures to structured data and find patterns
```

### 4. Session Management Module
- Creates and loads sessions in format: [casino_name]-[game]-[date]-[time]
- Saves all request/response data, screenshots, and extracted symbols
- Maintains searchable history of sessions
- Exports session data for external analysis

```python
# Key implementation in session_manager.py
class SessionManager:
    def start_new_session(self, casino_name, game_name):
        """Start a new capture session"""
        session_id = f"{casino_name}-{game_name}-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S')}"
        # Create session structure and return session object
```

### 5. User Interface
- Dashboard for monitoring active captures
- Request/response viewer with syntax highlighting
- Symbol grid showing extracted symbols for each spin
- Pattern analysis results visualization
- Session history browser with filtering options
- Screenshot viewer synchronized with request data

```python
# Key implementation in app.py
class SlotAnalyzerApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        # Initialize UI components and connect to backend modules
```

## Implementation Details

### Network Traffic Capture
- Use `mitmproxy` as a proxy to intercept HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- For WebSocket (WS/WSS), use the same proxy with WebSocket handlers
- Capture request/response pairs with timestamps
- Take screenshots at each response using `pyautogui`
- Store all data in structured format for analysis

### Symbol Recognition
- Use OpenCV for image processing and template matching
- Implement a training mode where users can define symbol templates
- For each game, store a layout map of where symbols appear on screen
- Extract symbols from screenshots based on game-specific layouts
- Associate symbols with corresponding network responses

### Pattern Recognition
- Analyze bet sizes, lines, and outcomes for correlations
- Identify repeated response patterns
- Compare symbol combinations across spins
- Use statistical methods to identify non-random patterns
- Generate reports on potential patterns found

### Session Management
- Save sessions in structured format: `[casino_name]-[game]-[date]-[time]`
- Store all request/response data, screenshots, and extracted symbols
- Implement loading of previous sessions
- Maintain a searchable history of sessions
- Support exporting data for external analysis

### User Interface
- Main dashboard showing current capture status
- Request/response viewer with syntax highlighting for JSON/XML
- Symbol grid showing extracted symbols for each spin
- Pattern analysis results view
- Session history browser
- Screenshot viewer synchronized with request data

## Capture Information Requirements

For each captured request/response:

1. **Symbols associated to the capture**
   - Visual representation of symbols on reels
   - Position information for each symbol
   - Special symbol indicators (wilds, scatters, etc.)

2. **Bet size and line information**
   - Amount wagered
   - Number of lines played
   - Timestamp of the bet

3. **Game identification**
   - Name of the game
   - Casino platform
   - Game version if available

4. **Uniqueness analysis**
   - Flag for duplicate responses
   - References to previous identical captures
   - Frequency analysis of response patterns

5. **Temporal information**
   - Date and time of capture
   - Session duration
   - Time between spins
